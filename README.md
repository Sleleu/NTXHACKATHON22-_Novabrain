# NTXHACKATHON22-_Novabrain

## NovaBrain Project

This project was created on the occasion of the NTX hackathon 2022. Three tracks are available :

- Tech / handson : Working with neurotechnology, computational neuroscience, data analysis or any other hardware and software usefull
- The data challenge : Focused on data science, a challenge with the objective of recognizing the age of an individual's brain
- Design / strategy / eveything else : Track for everyone else, about design, ethics..

## How it works

NovaBrain is a python application acts as a virtual assistant interacting between the user and the phone. A menu is left at the disposal of the user, and commands are enumerated vocally to the user.
NovaBrain captures the signals from the jaw to validate one of the options listed vocally. To make this possible, a [BITalino](https://www.pluxbiosignals.com/collections/bitalino#:~:text=BITalino%20is%20an%20affordable%20%26%20open,and%20applications%20using%20physiological%20sensors.) device is used, and the expected signal is captured using [Opensignal](https://www.opensignal.com/).

## Expected results

The ultimate goal of this project is to have the possibility to simply customize any type of application from the virtual assistant for a minimal number of signals to be detected. Moreover, to capture signals with a confidence index sufficient to reduce false positives and false negatives to a minimum.

In practical application, Novabrain could find an application to reduce dependency and increase the autonomy of people with reduced mobility.
